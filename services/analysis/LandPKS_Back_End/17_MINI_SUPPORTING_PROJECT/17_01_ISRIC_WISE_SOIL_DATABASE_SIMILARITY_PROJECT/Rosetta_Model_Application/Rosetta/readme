NOTE:  This software is under development, but will most likely provide correct estimates of soil hydraulic parameters.  
The estimated parameters/values may change in future. Models may be deleted or added,file-formats may change.

Please report any bugs to me: mschaap@ussl.ars.usda.gov


INSTALLATION
============

unzip rosetta2.zip into a folder (use pkzip or winzip)
MAKE SURE that
1) there is a subfolder called weights (containing 11 files)
2) rosetta.exe, cygwin1.dll and ex_input.txt are present

USAGE - TESTING THE PROGRAM
=====   ===================

1) open DOS window in MS-windows
2) navigate (cd) to the folder where rosetta was installed
3) type 
      rosetta

You should see the following output:

Usage:   Rosetta ConfigDir Model Inputfile Outputfile 




USAGE - RUNNING AN EXAMPLE
=====   ==================

type
Rosetta WEIGHTS 3 ex_input.txt ex_output,txt

You should see the same output as above plus lines saying

processing......
............Done!

You just ran Model 3 with the file ex_input.txt as input data and 
generated the results file ex_output.txt

The other models can be run by selecting a different model number.


SOMETHING ABOUT THE MODELS IN ROSETTA2
======================================

The models have different data requirements but all read their input from one file.  When insufficient data is available -9.9 is listed in the output.

************
Model 1 through 5: traditional Rosetta models. See:

Schaap, M.G., F.J. Leij, and M.Th. van Genuchten, 2001.  Rosetta: a computer program for estimating soil hydraulic parameters with hierarchical pedotransfer functions. J. of Hydr. 251:163-176.

Model 6 through 10: modified versions of models 1 through 5, please see the PDF (acrobat) file schaap_etal_2002.pdf for more information.


Models 1..10 estimate van Genuchten (1980) water retention parameters (Theta_R, Theta_S, ALPHA, N), saturated conductivity (Ks). It also estimates unsaturated conductivity parameters of the Mualem-van Genuchten model (van Genuchten, 1980; Schaap and Leij): Ko and L. See:

Schaap, M.G., and F.J. Leij, 2000. Improved prediction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with the Mualem-van Genuchten model, Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J., 64:843-851.


**********
Model 11 and 12: see PDF file for more information. These models were derived from:

Rawls, W.J., and D.L. Brakensiek, 1985. Prediction of soil water properties for hydrologic modeling. p 293-299. In: Jones, E.B. and T.J. Ward (eds.), Watershed Management in the Eighties. Proc. Irrig. Drain. Div., ASCE, Denver, CO. April 30 - May 1, 1985., 34, 3293-3302.

Model 11: Brooks-Corey (1964) parameters (Theta_R, Theta_S, HB, N (aka Lambda) and Ks
Model 12: van Genuchten (1980) parameters Theta_R, Theta_S, ALPHA, N) derived from Brooks-Corey parameters, Ks. (see above reference) 


***********
Model 13 and 14: see PDF file for more information. These models were derived from:

Cosby B.J., G.M Hornberger, R.B. Clapp, and T.R. Ginn, 1984. A statistical exploration of the relationships of soil moisture characteristics to the physical properties of soils. Water Resour. Res. 20:683-690.

Both model 13 and 14 estimate Campbell (1974) parameters, which were converted to Brooks-Corey parameters (Theta_R, Theta_S, HB, N (aka Lambda) and Ks



***********
Model 15 see PDF file for more information. This model was derived from:

Vereecken, H., J. Maes, J. Feyen, and P. Darius, 1989. Estimating the soil moisture retention characteristic from texture, bulk density, and carbon content. Soil Sci. 148:389-403.

This model estimates parameters of MODIFIED van Genuchten curve See reference and PDF file). The second exponent in the VG curve is traditionally set to 1-1/N, here this exponent is equal to 1. Estimated: Theta_R, Theta_S, ALPHA, N and Ks



************
Model 16 see PDF file for more information. This model was derived from:

Wösten J.H.M., A. Lilly, A. Nemes, and C. Le Bas. 1999. Development and use of a database of hydraulic properties of European soils. Geoderma 90:169-185.

Estimated parameters: van Genuchten (1980) water retention parameters (Theta_R, Theta_S, ALPHA, N), saturated conductivity (Ks). It also estimates L parameter in the unsaturated conductivity of Mualem-van Genuchten model (van Genuchten, 1980; Schaap and Leij).
